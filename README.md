Notion API used as a CMS. Published & deployed on Heroku.

__USING NOTION AS A CMS__

As the new Notion API has been released few days ago, I tried to display my Notion pages of a specific group with React.
It Works well but may be faster : regrouping frontend app in the backend one to retrieve directly component. 
It actually calls my custom API that herself calls Notion.
